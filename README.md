This is a basic Task manager project made in react to pratcice my skills and make them better and get more used to react, its syntax and practices.

# The Concepts That I Practised On In This Project Were:
1. Functional Components:Building blocks of react.
2. State Management: useState is used for managing the state of tasks, new task input, error messages, and task editing.
3. Event Handling: Event handlers are used for adding, updating, deleting, and toggling tasks.
4. Conditional Rendering: Conditional rendering is used to display different UI elements based on the editing state of a task.
5. Styled Components: Styled components are used for styling the app, keeping the styles scoped to the components.
